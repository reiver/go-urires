# go-urires

Package **urires** — `/uri-res/` — provides **a trivial convention for using HTTP in URN resolution** (as per RFC-2169),
which is useful for creating a **content-addressable web**,
which nowadays would be considered useful, and even necessary for a **distributed web**, or **decentralized web**.
